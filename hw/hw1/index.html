                <p> If you are a Computer Scientist or Graphic Designer, you may have heard of <b>Raster</b> or <b>Vector</b> graphical images. </p>
                <p> Wether you know it or not, these image types make up a large portion of what you view on the internet. </p>
                <p> Before we go into depth of each image type, what exactly are Raster and <b>Vector</b> images? </p>

                <blockquote> 
                    <b>Raster</b> images, also known as bitmaps, are made of individual pixels of color. 
                    Pixels are placed in a rectangular grid where each color pixel contributes to the overall image.

                <h2> Vector Graphics: </h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <b>Vector</b> graphics are made up of paths, each with a mathematical formula (or <b>Vector</b>) which tells the path 
                    how it is shaped and what color it is bordered with or filled by.
